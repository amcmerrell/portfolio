## Description

_This website provides information about Andrew's background, experience, as well as a working list of web development projects. In addition to my own HTML and CSS, this project makes use of Bootstrap and Font Awesome CSS, JS, and font files. Future iterations will expand upon the portfolio and add more functionality to the website._
